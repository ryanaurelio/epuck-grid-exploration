Engineering Notebook

# 15th December 2021
* Check the physical condition of the robot.
* Try to turn on and off the robot.

# 21st December 2021
* Installed USB driver for Windows.
* Drivers already installed
* When choosing USB Serial (CDC) there is only "Downgrade Driver" option
* USB serial ports:
  + (COM3) e-puck2 GDB Server
  + (COM4) e-puck2 Serial Monitor
  + (COM5) e-puck2 STM32F407
* PC interface not responding when trying to connect to COM5
* Following the steps from https://www.gctronic.com/doc/index.php?title=e-puck2_robot_side_development.
* Downloaded Eclipse IDE for e-puck2.
* Error when trying to build the project.
* Found a website for coding in python: https://www.giters.com/davidfrisch/UNIFR_API_EPUCK.
* Also considering another website for PC side development: https://www.gctronic.com/doc/index.php?title=e-puck2_PC_side_development.

# 22nd December 2021
* Re-build the project in Eclipse IDE without connecting to the robot.
* Project compiled successfully.
* Trying to use PC interface again.
* Success by setting the selector to 8.
* Trying the robot sensors to detect multiple color of highlighters.
* e-puck2 doesn't react to any highlighter.
* In comparison to the e-puck in the webots, our e-puck doesn't have IR sensor at the bottom.

# 2nd January 2022
* Connect via Bluetooth.
* Testing the PC interface via UART.
* Established connection with python.
* Print available commands.

# 4th January 2022
* Trying different commands from advanced sercom protocol: https://www.gctronic.com/doc/index.php/Advanced_sercom_protocol.
* Try to parse all sensors from advanced sercom v2.
* Temperature not available.
* No floor sensors.

# 5th January 2022
*Tried to connect the E-puck with Wi-Fi
*Tried to update the firmware but got gdb error
*Checked the Wi-Fi with executable from the website
*Tried to open webots and ROS
*Tried to find out about the lag in Wi-Fi connection (the sound repeats itself after few notes, etc)

#6th January 2022
*Still trying to figure out about the lag
*Tried to connect webots with E-puck, but program crashes everytime tried to input ipaddr (still no progress)
*Tried to update ROS-hydro from the gctronic website, because it's no longer supported, but no avail
*Tried to connect to older version of webots, got the same result
*Tried to connect to webots in ROS-hydro, but the app was very laggy in VM, tried to resolve this issue, but no avail
*Tried to download ROS and install it manually, not yet done, considering need a great amount of time we needed
    and little time we had

#7th January 2022
Sick after getting Covid booster

#8th January 2022
*Still sick, but little better
*Making progress in making the E-puck moves
*Making the map and implements algorithm

#9th January 2022
*Algorithm done
*Considering making the E-puck went back to first place after it is done with the algorithm




# Ideas:
(1) Map detection: Check algorithm for vacuum robot
* First the robot will explore the area to make a map.
* Map is known to all robots.
* Start to explore.
Problem: 
* Calculating the distance inside the area.
* Creating a map:
  * The proximity of the distance

(2) Image recognition: Using machine learning to replace floor sensors
* Tapes are set across the map.
* Robot only able to move on top of tape.
* The goal is to have 100% tape coverage.
Problems:
* Refresh rate of the camera is very low.
